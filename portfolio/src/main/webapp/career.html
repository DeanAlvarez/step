        <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p>After completeing graduate school, I hope to be involved in research in some capacity, be it academic or industrial. Until then,
             I hope to broaden my expertise through summer internships.</p>
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <ul class="page-list">
            <li><h2>STEP Intern @ Google | Summer 2020</h2></li>
            <p>In Progress!</p>            
            <li><h2>Deep Learning Engineer @ CACI | Summer 2019</h2></li>
            <p>During this internship, I worked on a project as part of a small team. We were intrested in reasearching a particular method of creating artifical data to supplement
                smaller datasets. I created evaluation tools for the team which had various metrics such as f2 score. I also created a script for building the ImageNet data into 
                a COCO style detection dataset. I also built tools to simulate low-shot learning on a full dataset. Finally, I created a docker image to streamline usage of the
                Tensorflow Object Detection API.</p>
            <li><h2>Computer Science Summer Institute @ Google | Summmer 2019</h2></li>
            <p>This three-week summer program culminating in the creation of the meme-search-inator with two other team members. 
                The meme-search-inator is a search engine for memes. In particular, I worked on the backend framework as well as the sites search functionality 
                which were built using Google AppEngine's datastore along with python and jinja2.
                As for the search algorithm, I used a simple relevance based search which tokenized the search query and found the memes which had the most tags
                 in common with the query.</p>
            <li><h2>Junior Research Scientist @ CACI | Summer 2018</h2></li>
            <p>During this internship, I worked to research the effect of class grouping on the performance of object detectors. In doing this, 
                I experimented with many different architectures such as single-shot-detectors, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet. I had to build various training 
                datasets with different class groupings in order to do this. I also modified the dataset building script to allow for continious writing. This decreased the RAM
                usage of the script and allowed for bigger datasets to be built.</p>
            <li><h2>Intern @ Nitro Solutions | Summer 2017</h2></li>
            <p>During this internship I wrote data collection software for a proof of concept AI System using c# and the .Net framework.</p>
